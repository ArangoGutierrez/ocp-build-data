  # ART does not push to this upstream registry location. It is built by
  # DPTP pipelines when changes are detected to the builder:ubi8.art image,
  # described by the do-not-use--art-rhel-8 stream below.
  # The upstream_image is used by DPTP tooling to make sure that upstream images
  # build using ART base images. In this case, we need an ART image, but one
  # with changes layered on top so that those images can yum install dependencies
  # without a subscription.
  # Note that it must be qualified by {MAJOR}.{MINOR} so that it installs non-CDN
  # rpms for the appropriate release.
